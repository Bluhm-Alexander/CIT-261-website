			Problem 2: Storing Single Numbers and Arrays of Numbers
		</div>
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
			<p>
			From what I can tell Web Storage only allows string and numbers to
			be stored as directly Accessible variables everything else has to
			be done with JSON.
			</p>
			
			<p>
			I'm Going to Store The Following Numbers Individually:<br>
			5<br>
			3<br>
			7<br>
			</p>

			Notes on Local Storage API
		</div>
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
		<p>There are two different Storage Types available to us in the 
		localStorage API. The first one is the local storage object. 
		Local storage objects save information to the clients computer and
		that information will be stored without a expiration date. The 
		only thing that can expire said information is when the client clears
		the browser's cache. You can also clear a local storage object with
		<b>localStorage.removeItem("item");</b>.
		</p>
		
		<p>The other type of storage is Session storage which only saves things
		for as long as the user keeps the window or tab open. You can also use the
		 removeItem() function and it works the same way.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		It should be mentioned that there are some security risks for using the 
		web Storage API. Any javascript can modify it's contents so unless you
		build some sort of hashing system with PHP or some other language
		it is not a good Idea to store sensitive information in there.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Now that all your variables are saved inside webstorage as JSON
		objects you can now have some fun navigating to completely new pages
		and being able to recover the information you have entered.
		</p>
		
		<p>
		Also you can only store strings into web Storage.
