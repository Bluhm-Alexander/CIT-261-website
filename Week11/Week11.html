		<h1>Using JavaScript Events and Animation and Transition Events</h1>
		
		<h2>This HTML document is linked to the JavaScript file Week10-Coding.js</h2>
		
		<div class="explanation">
			<p>Located in the Week06-Coding.js file is the code that is used
			to test out the following concepts: Standard JavaScript Events 
			Including those for Mobile Devices ( Ex. onTouchBegin, onLoad, etc.)
			and Animation and Transition Events</p>

		<!--Problem 1-->

		<div class="wrapper">
			<div class="loop-tester" id="all">
				<p>
				This is a simple event that will be triggered by the JavaScript onLoad
				in the body tag of the HTML. it triggers a transition and animation where all the DIV
				Boxes will Slide in from the left. Please refer to problem1() in the JavaScript.
				It should be noted that onLoad can be triggered in HTML. But I'm going to do it in
				Javscript as per instruction.

				Note That Only This Box will change Listeners only listen for their
				own boxes unless there is a global factor at play.</p>

				<p>Notice how the sprite is animated I did this entirely in CSS
				The listeners are in Javascript as well.

					We will now experiment with CSS3's event listeners. We will use the hover
					attribute and the active attributes specifically. CSS3 will Listen for the
					events and will Transition.

					Standard JavaScript Event Handlers cover a wide variety of events. Here is
					a link for the page I will be referencing at length for the entirety of this page
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp">Link</a>. There are a few
					ways you can handle events with JavaScript. For this page I'm mainly going to be
					handling events from the HTML page itself. The HTML page listens for events that 
					the user causes and then immediately executes JavaScript code in response to the
					event.
					<br><br>
					For Problem1 I employed the onload function in the javascript itself because event handlers
					can be hard coded into the Javascript file itself. This method is called bubbling and capturing.
					This method was employed in the 90s and is not really used today. The standard syntax for hard coding
					event Listeners: button[i].addEventListener("click", buttonClick, capture). Like I said
					this method is old an unnecessary.
					<br><br>
					This all being said there are a couple other things to be said about event listeners.
					HTML5 has listeners that are specific to mobile devices. An example would be the <b>Touch
					Events</b>. onTouchStart is called when the user touches the screen, likewise
					onTouchEnd is called when the user's finger stops touching the screen.
