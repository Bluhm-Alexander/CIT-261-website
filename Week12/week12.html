			HTML5 Tags are very simple and efficient. They basically work by 
			probing the directory for the file linked in the source and then it is
			left up to the browser to Render and play the Video. In the tag it is also
			important to define what file type the video is. MP4 is the most supported
			Video Format so that is what I will be using. Also of note is that you can
			Manipulate the properties of the video tag with DOM. So I have included three
			buttons that change the size of the Video Display.<br><br> Also there is no sound in
			this clip it is stock footage.

			<p>
				There are only 3 main audio formats that are supported by HTML5. Those formats are
				FLAC, WAVE, MP3 and OGG. Matroska or WEBM also has some limited support it
				really depends on what the browsers can render. The safe route for most browsers
				with Audio is MP3.

				  <source src="Latency.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
				If you are seeing this message it means your browser is too old.

		<div class="loop-tester">
			<p>
				Canvas is very Interesting some time ago I used canvas to display a small triangle
				with WebGL. I wrote this small program so I could break myself into OpenGL. the WebGL
				code is located in the Javascript File.

			Additional Notes on WEBGL and Canvas
		</div>
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
		<p>
			I don't think there is much to talk about in regards to HTML multi-media tags.
			I've made notes up above you can refer to. No I want to focus on HTML Canvas.
			HTML canvas is some pretty exciting stuff it can be used to make games with WEBGL
			which is fairly efficient. Or you can draw simple shapes and text usually with Javascript<br><br>
			
			Canvas can repsond to events such as mouse clicks and key presses which are also handled
			by java. By default Canvas has neither borders nor content whatever is drawn
			within has to be coded into it.
