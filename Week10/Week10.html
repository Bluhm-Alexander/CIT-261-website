				The main difference between transitions and animations is key frames.
				Transitions operate on properties alone. Animations depend on key frames.

			<button onclick="startAnimation()" style="margin-top: 210px">Start</button>
			<button onclick="stopAnimation()" style="margin-top: 210px">Stop</button>

			Notes on CSS3 and WebKit Animations.
		</div>
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
			<p>
				Let us first start with transitions. Simply put transitions are a prebuilt function
				included in CSS3 where you can set a property inside the CSS tag and the element will change
				its property smoothly and without intervention from Javascript. There are two settings
				you have to set which is the type of transition and its duration.<br><br>
				
				As for Animation you must define the Keyframes of your animations. And then
				trigger the event with either an event attribute with CSS such as hover or you trigger the event
				with javascript. That is an important note all of these animations and Transitions can be done
				by CSS alone. But it is a lot easier to use Javascript because Javascipt has window
				events. It really depends on your situation.<br><br>
				
				Different rules can be acessed with CSS Animations with JavaScript:<br><br>
				name<br>
				cssRules<br>
				appendRule()<br>
				deleteRule()<br>
				findRule()<br>
