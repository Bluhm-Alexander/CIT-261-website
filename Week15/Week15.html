				Problem 1: Animating Sprites

					<b>Use The Arroy Keys to Control Mario</b>
					<br><br>
					You Can Use animations to create Sprite Animations by using a sprite sheet
					like you would in conventional game programming. I will be using both
					JavaScript and predefined animations to demonstrate this.

				Problem 2: Rainbow DIV

			<div class="loop-tester">
				<p>This is hust a Simple Div Box That Changes to every color.
				I'm going to make the animtion slow enough that it won't give anyone 
				ceizures.</p>
				<p>The important thing to remember is that Animations can encompass
				color, position, sprites, you name it.</p>
				
				<div id="demo1">Crazy Colors</div>
				
				<button type="button" onclick="problem2()">Play / Pause</button>

				Problem 3: Moving and Rotating A DIV

			<div class="loop-tester" style="height: 500px;">
				<p>
					You can Define predesignated tranforms in CSS animations
					Giving them an almost 3D effect.

				<div id="demo2">

				Notes: CSS3 Animations Without Libraries

				<p>
					Animations are very useful tools because of one huge factor.
					You can make animations infinite and they can be easily called
					with javaScript making your code mush easier to use and understand.
					Such was the case with my animated mario sprite. There are multiple
					keyframe sets all for different situations.
					<br><br>
					Animations are also powerful in the fact that you can use them either
					to make tweens or play them in steps. Tweens are when you smoothly
					transition an objact from on state to another. Steps are when wou move
					or change your object in a jerky manor. Refer to my Mario Charecter if 
					you would like to see stepping animations in action.
