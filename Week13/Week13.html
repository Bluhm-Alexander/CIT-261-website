				Notes: CSS3 Animations Without Libraries

			<div class="loop-tester">
				<p>
					I will start out by talking about what exacly are CSS3 Animation Libraries are.
					CSS3 Animation Libraries are custom built code that can be copy and pasted into
					your CSS and Javascript Files directly.
					<br><br>
					I'm goin to write this library with animated menus and dynamically loaded 
					information that will slide onto the screen without navigating to a new 
					page.
					<br><br>
					It should be remembered that using animations for presenting information
					is rather taxing on the web browser. Some Browsers just refuse to load 
					certain transitions. I spent hours trying to get the DIV Boxes to slide
					from left to right only to realize that such a feat was beyond me. So 
					setelled for expanding and shrinking boxes.
					<br><br>
					All of my examples are very simple and only include opacity and margin transitions
					Along with dynamically expanding and contracting with the use of transitions.
					<br><br>
					With transitions you can specify size, opacity, position, timing, type of 
					animation and the delay on the animation.
