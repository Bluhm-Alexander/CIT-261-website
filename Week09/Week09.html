				Hello darkness, my old friend
				I've come to talk with you again
				Because a vision softly creeping
				Left its seeds while I was sleeping
				And the vision that was planted in my brain
				Still remains
				Within the sound of silence
				<br><br>
				In restless dreams I walked alone
				Narrow streets of cobblestone
				Neath the halo of a streetlamp
				I turned my collar to the cold and damp
				When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light
				That split the night
				And touched the sound of silence
				<br><br>
				And in the naked light I saw
				Ten thousand people, maybe more
				People talking without speaking
				People hearing without listening
				People writing songs that voices never share
				No one dare
				Disturb the sound of silence
				<br><br>
				Fools said I, You do not know
				Silence like a cancer grows
				Hear my words that I might teach you
				Take my arms that I might reach you
				But my words like silent raindrops fell
				And echoed in the wells of silence
				<br><br>
				And the people bowed and prayed
				To the neon god they made
				And the sign flashed out its warning
				In the words that it was forming
				And the sign said The words of the prophets
				Are written on the subway walls
				And tenement halls
				And whispered in the sounds of silence

			<p>
				Manipulating CSS properties is done through DOM in HTML. All you need to do to 
				set a CSS property is either call it by name or by ID. Then you simply call the
				style operator and then the name of the property you would like to change.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than that there really isn't that much to change.
