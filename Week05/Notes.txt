This week I am tackling JSON Objects

There really isn't much to say about JSON objects other than it is really
locked down. You can create JSON objects easily you can store them locally
but if you want to bounce from page to page with a certain JSON object
you have to have web server handle the transaction.

For Security reasons JSON objects are really closely gaurded and for good reason
most JSON objects are not encrypted in any sort of way and you don't want
people loading in stuff into your javascript functions. 

It is up to the browser for the amount of security that is to be employed
as to what can be accessed. For example you can store JSON objects locally
in the browser cache using localStorage.setItem("testJSON", myJSON);

But you cant load in from another directory such as C:/users/school/ because
it is a security violation at least with Chrome.
