		<h1>Using XMLHTTPRequests to Consume a JSON web Service</h1>
		
		<h2>This HTML document is linked to the JavaScript file Week07-Coding.js</h2>
		
		<div class="explanation">
			<p>Located in the Week06-Coding.js file is the code that is used
			to test out the following concepts: XMLHTTPRequests and JSON Web Service.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="subHeading">
			Problem1
		</div>
		
		<!--Problem 1-->
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
			<p>This Function calls problem1() in Week07-Coding.js file. It loads in a shopping list
			which is displayed properly with no bells and whistles required.
        </p>
			
		<h3>Shopping List</h3>
			
		<ol id="shopping">
		</ol>
			
		<button type="button" onclick="problem1()">Display Shopping List</button>

			Notes on XMLHTTPRequests
		</div>
		
		<div class="loop-tester">
		<p>I've decided to include notes inside my web pages now because why not. JSON web services
		are Web services or client side code that uses JSON to fill in information from the
		server. For example I am using JavaScript to read and display the Contents of a JSON
		file. This stuff is very useful for lets say displaying a catalog.</p>
		
		<p>XMLHTTPRequests is basically a way for the web server to serve information to the user.
		To be more particular it is a API (Application program interface) that is integrated
		into javascript. XMLHTTPRequest is an object that can be allocated and then passed information
		in our particular case a JSON File.
		
		If the pass in was succeful and informatio is served properly we should get a 200 status.
		There are other status's but listsing all of them would be exhaustive instead got to
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status"> this link</a> if
		you want to see what all the different staus messages mean.
